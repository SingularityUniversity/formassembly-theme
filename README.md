# FormAssembly Theme Development Kit

## Getting Started

### Requirements
Make sure you have both Git and Node installed.
* Git ([setup instructions](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git))
* Node ([setup instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)) 

### Setup

1. In the command line, run the following commands to checkout the Theme Development Kit and install dependencies.    
```text
git clone https://github.com/veerwest/formassembly-theme-dev-kit
cd formassembly-theme-dev-kit
npm install
npm install -g gulp-cli
```
2. Create a branch. Please name your branch after yourself, using your own name, alias or handle (no space allowed).
 ```text
git branch YOUR_NAME
```

3. Create your first theme by running `gulp create` from the command line.
```text
gulp create
```
When prompted, enter a name for your new theme.
```text
[23:28:35] Using gulpfile ~/formassembly-theme-dev-kit/gulpfile.js
[23:28:35] Starting 'create'...
âœ” Choose a name for your theme: 
```
Theme names cannot have space or non-alphanumeric characters in them.

### Work on your Theme

From the command line, run `gulp watch`. Leave the command running while you're working on the theme to ensure that the 
build files are correctly updated. 
```text
gulp watch
```

#### Edit your Theme Files

The theme creation step automatically created a folder for your theme: 
`src/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME`

In this folder, you'll find a series of scss files covering the various components of a FormAssembly theme.

```text
_autosuggest.scss
_buttons.scss
_calendar.scss
...
```
 >**Those files are the only files you will need to modify**. 
 Anything outside of your /src/themes folder does not need 
to and should not be modified.

You may edit the scss files with your favorite editor. 

#### Preview your Theme

To preview your theme as you edit the scss files, open /preview/THEME_NAME.html in your browser. As long as the 
`gulp watch` command is still running, you should be able to see your changes when refreshing the page.

Any SCSS compilation error will be displayed in the terminal window where `gulp watch` is running.

To preview your changes without reloading the page each time, you can install the 
[LiveReload extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en).
Once installed, click the LiveReload icon in Chrome to enable the extension on your preview page and restart the 
`gulp watch` command.

#### Save your Progress

From the command line, you can save your changes to github with the following command: 
```
git add -A && git commit -m && git push
```

### Submit your Theme

Open a Pull Request on gitlab. https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

### Create Additional Themes

Run `gulp create` any time you want to work on a new theme. 
**Caution**, if you choose the name of an existing theme, it will get overwritten.

### Update the Theme Dev Kit

From time to time, FormAssembly may update the dev kit to account for new features and improvements to Themes. To bring 
your local copy of the Theme Dev Kit up to date, stop your `gulp watch` command (if running) then run:
```text
git merge master
gulp refresh
gulp watch
``` 
You can then resume work. Any change in HTML markup and baseline CSS will be reflected in the Preview pages.
